Update theming on github site.
- Title bar especially needs rework

Update bio

Meeting recaps?

Add ./favicon.ico

Add Time and Space Complexity explanations/analysis

Link to actual python solution files with code snippets

More charts and graphs and visual stuff

Write about more "pythonic" way to code algorithms (using `all(...)`, `any(...)`,`min(...)`, etc.)

Revisions:
- Ensure the use of consistent language, and consistent definitions of terms
- Be less verbose
- Perhaps even less assumptions about programming knowledge (kinda conflicts with previous task but whatever)
- More hyperlinks to external sources to talk about concepts that I don't have time to get into (time complexity, caching/dictionary usage, bitwise stuff, etc.)
  - Also links of related problems for people to solve
